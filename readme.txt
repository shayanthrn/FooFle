for starting program install node js on your pc then go to the UI directory with cmd and type commend below:
>node server.js
after that open your browser and go to the url below
http://localhost:3000


pay attention:
if u want to use program and there is no * * * * * in userinfo
insert record to userinfo and userlogininfo with values(*,*,*,....)
then start the program
(but if u dont change anything in foofle.sql there is the record (*,*,*,*...) in the database already)


data in database:
user:shayantest 
pass:shayan1

user:*
pass:*



the ERD graph is in the ERD.PDF
UI program is in UI
and foofle database configuration is in foofle.sql
